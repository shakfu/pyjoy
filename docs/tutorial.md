# An informal tutorial on Joy

*Abstract:* Joy is a functional programming language which is not based
on the application of functions to arguments but on the composition of
functions. It does not use lambda-abstraction of expressions but instead
it uses quotation of expressions. A large number of what are called
combinators are used to perform dequotation, they have the effect of
higher order functions. Several of them can be used to eliminate
recursive definitions. Programs in Joy are compact and often look just
like postfix notation. Writing programs and reasoning about them is made
easy because there is no substitution of actual for formal parameters.

This tutorial describes basic features of the language Joy which are
likely to be the same in all implementations.

*Keywords:* functional programming, higher order functions, composition
of functions, combinators, elimination of recursive definitions,
variable free notation

## Introduction

Although the theory of Joy is of interest, this tutorial exposition
avoids theory as much as possible.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: This introductory
section continues with a very short outline of some distinguishing
features of the language. The next two sections introduce the basic data
types and operations on them. The section after that returns to the
central feature of Joy: quotations of programs and their use with
combinators. After a short section on definitions the next section
resumes the discussion of combinators, in particular those that can
eliminate the need for recursive definitions. In the final section
several short programs and one larger program are used to illustrate
programming with aggregates in Joy.

To add two integers, say 2 and 3, and to write their sum, you type the
program

            2  3  +

This is ordinary postfix notation, a reverse form of a notation first
used by Polish logicians in the 1920s. Its advantage is that in complex
expressions no parentheses are needed. Internally it works like this:
the first numeral causes the integer 2 to be pushed onto a stack. The
second numeral causes the integer 3 to be pushed on top of that. Then
the addition operator pops the two integers off the stack and pushes
their sum, 5. The system reads inputs like the above and executes them
when they are terminated by a period `"."`, like this:

            2  3  + .

In the default mode there is no need for an explicit output instruction,
so the numeral `5` is now written to the output file which normally is
the screen. So, in the default mode the terminating `"."` may be taken
to be an instruction to write the top element of the stack. In what
follows the terminating period will not be shown any further.

Apart from integers, the current version of Joy as extended by John
Cowan has real numbers or "floats". Arithmetic operations on floats
are just like those on integers. The following multiplies two numbers\

            2.34  5.67  *

and leaves their product, `13.2678`, on top of the stack. (So, to see
the result on the terminal, the above line has to terminated by a
period.)

To compute the square of an integer, it has to be multiplied by itself.
To compute the square of the sum of two integers, the sum has to be
multiplied by itself. Preferably this should be done without computing
the sum twice. The following is a program to compute the square of the
sum of 2 and 3:

            2  3  +  dup  *

After the sum of 2 and 3 has been computed, the stack just contains the
integer 5. The `dup` operator then pushes another copy of the 5
onto the stack. Then the multiplication operator replaces the two
integers by their product, which is the square of 5. The square is then
written out as 25. Apart from the `dup` operator there are several
others for re-arranging the top of the stack. The `pop` operator
removes the top element, and the `swap` operator interchanges the
top two elements. This is quite different from proper postfix notation,
because the stack manipulators only make sense in the presence of a
stack. Such notation is also used in some pocket calculators, the Unix
utility dc, the typesetting language Postscript and the general purpose
language Forth. Billy Tanksley has suggested that this be called
concatenative notation. The theory of this notation is a topic unto
itself, but it will not be dealt with in this tutorial.

A *list* of integers is written inside square brackets. Just as integers
can be added and otherwise manipulated, so lists can be manipulated in
various ways. The following `concat`enates two lists:

            [1 2 3]  [4 5 6 7]  concat

The two lists are first pushed onto the stack. Then the `concat`
operator pops them off the stack and pushes the list `[1 2 3 4 5 6 7]`
onto the stack. There it may be further manipulated or it may be written
to the output file.

The elements of a list need not be all of the same type, and the
elements can be lists themselves. The following uses a list containing
one integer, two floats and one list of three integers.

            [ 3.14  42  [1 2 3]  0.003 ]   dup  concat

The `dup` operator will push a copy of the list on top of the
stack, where the two lists will then be concatenated into one.

Joy makes extensive use of *combinator*s. These are like operators in
that they expect something specific on top of the stack. But unlike
operators they execute what they find on top of the stack, and this has
to be the *quotation* of a program, enclosed in square brackets. One of
these is a combinator for `map` elements of one list via a
function to another list. Consider the program\

            [1 2 3 4]  [dup *]  map

It first pushes the list of integers and then the quoted program onto
the stack. The `map` combinator then removes the list and the quotation
and constructs another list by applying the program to each member of
the given list. The result is the list `[1 4 9 16]` which is left on top
of the stack.

In *definition*s of new functions no formal parameters are used, and
hence there is no substitution of actual parameters for formal
parameters. After the following definition\

            square   ==   dup  *

the symbol `square` can be used in place of ` dup * `.

Definitions occur in blocks such as the following:
\

        DEFINE
            square  ==  dup * ;
        cube    ==  dup dup * * .

As the example shows, definition mode is initiated by the reserved word
`DEFINE` and extends to the period. Individual definitions are separated
by semicolons. In libraries the initiator `LIBRA` is used instead of
`DEFINE`. In the remainder of this paper the initiator, the separator
and the terminator will generally not be shown any further.

As in other programming languages, definitions may be recursive, for
example in the definition of the factorial function. That definition
uses a certain recursive pattern that is useful elsewhere. In Joy there
is a combinator for *primitive recursion* which has this pattern built
in and thus avoids the need for a definition. The `primrec`
combinator expects two quoted programs in addition to a data parameter.
For an integer data parameter it works like this: If the data parameter
is zero, then the first quotation has to produce the value to be
returned. If the data parameter is positive then the second has to
combine the data parameter with the result of applying the function to
its predecessor. For the factorial function the required quoted programs
are very simple:

            [1]  [*]  primrec

computes the factorial recursively. There is no need for any definition.
For example, the following program computes the factorial of `5`:
\

            5  [1]  [*]  primrec

It first pushes the number `5` and then it pushes the two short quoted
programs. At this point the stack contains three elements. Then the
`primrec` combinator is executed. It pops the two quotations off the
stack and saves them elsewhere. Then `primrec` tests whether the top
element on the stack (initially the `5`) is equal to zero. If it is, it
pops it off and executes one of the quotations, the `[1]` which leaves
`1` on the stack as the result. Otherwise it pushes a decremented copy
of the top element and recurses. On the way back from the recursion it
uses the other quotation, `[*]`, to multiply what is now a factorial on
top of the stack by the second element on the stack. When all is done,
the stack contains `120`, the factorial of `5`.

As may be seen from this program, the usual branching of recursive
definitions is built into the combinator. The `primrec` combinator can
be used with many other quotation parameters to compute quite different
functions. It can also be used with data types other than integers.

Joy has many more combinators which can be used to calculate many
functions without forcing the user to give recursive or non-recursive
definitions. Some of the combinators are more data-specific than
`primrec`, and others are far more general.

## Integers, floats, characters and truth values

The data types of Joy are divided into simple and aggregate types. The
*simple* types comprise integers, floats (or reals), characters and the
truth values. The aggregate types comprise sets, strings and lists.
Literals of any type cause a value of that type to be pushed onto the
stack. There they can be manipulated by the general stack operations
such as `dup`, `pop` and `swap` and a few others, or
they can be manipulated by operators specific to their type. This
section introduces literals and operators of the simple types.

An *integer* is just a whole number. Literals of this type are written
in decimal notation. The following binary operations are provided:

            +        -        *        /        rem

The first four have their conventional meaning, the last is the operator
for the remainder after division. Operators are written after their
operands. Binary operators remove two values from the top of the stack
and replace them by the result. For example, the program\

            20  3  4  +  *  6  -  100  rem

evaluates to 34, and this value is left on top of the stack. There are
also some unary operators specific to integers like the `abs`
operator which takes the absolute value, and the `signum` operator
which yields `-1`, `0` or `+1`, depending on whether its parameter is
negative, zero or positive.

Apart from the positive and negative integers or whole numbers, Joy has
floating point numbers or "floats". Literals of this type are written
with a decimal point and at least one digit after that. Optionally the
last digit may be followed by \'E\' or \'e\' and then a positive or
negative exponent. Here are some examples:

            3.14     314.0     3.14E5    3.14e-5

The last two are equivalent to 314000.0 and 0.0000314 . Most operators
on integers work in the same way for floats. John Cowan\'s extension
also provides a large number of functions for floats, but these are
outside the scope of this tutorial.

A *character* is a letter, a digit, a punctuation character, in fact any
printable character or one of a few white space characters. Literals of
type character are written as a single quote followed by the character
itself. Values of type character are treated very much like small
numbers. That means that other numbers can be added to them, for example
32 to change letter from upper case to lower case. There are two unary
operators which are defined on characters and on integers: `pred`
takes the predecessor, [succ]{.kbd} takes the successor. For example,

            'A  32  +  succ  succ

evaluates to `'c`, the third lower case letter.

The type of *truth value*s is what in some languages is called
*Boolean*. The following are the two literals, the unary negation
operator and two binary operators for conjunction and disjunction:

            true        false        not        and        or

For example, the program\
\

            false  true  false  not  and  not  or

evaluates to `false`.

Values of type integer and character can be compared using the following
*relational operator*s:

            =        <        >        !=        <=        >=

The [!=]{.kbd} operator returns the negation of what the [=]{.kbd}
operator returns. The others have the conventional meaning. As all
operators, they are written in postfix notation. The result is always a
truth value. For example,\

            'A  'E  <  2  3  +  15  3  /  =  and

evaluates to `true`.

## Sets, strings and lists

The *aggregate* types are the unordered type of sets and the ordered
types of strings and lists. Aggregates can be built up, combined, taken
apart and tested for membership. This section introduces literals and
operators of the aggregate types.

A *set* is an unordered collection of zero or more small integers.
Literals of type set are written inside curly braces, and the empty set
is written as an empty pair of braces. For set literals the ordering of
the elements is irrelevant and duplication has no effect. The operators
for conjunction and disjunction are also defined on sets. For example,
the two equivalent programs\

            {1 3 5 7}  {2 4 6 8}  or  {}  or  {3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10}  and
            {3 7 5 1}  {2 4 6 8}  or  {}  or  {3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10} and

evaluate to `{3 4 5 6 7 8}`. The negation operator [not]{.kbd} takes
complements relative to the largest expressible set, which in most
implementations will have a maximum of 32 members: from `0` to `31`.

A *string* is an ordered sequence of zero or more characters. Literals
of this type string are written inside double quotes, and the empty
string is written as two adjacent double quotes with nothing inside:
`""`. Note that this is different from the string containing just the
blank: `" "`. Two strings can be concatenated, and a string can be
reversed. For example,\

        "dooG"  reverse  " morning"  " "  concat concat  "world"  concat

evaluates to `"Good morning world"`.

For many operators an implementation can choose whether to make it a
primitive or define it in a library. Apart from execution speed, to the
user it makes no difference as to which choice has been made. In the
current implementation the `reverse` operator is defined in a library.

A *list* is an ordered sequence of zero or more values of any type.
Literals of type list are written inside square brackets, the empty list
is written as an empty pair of brackets. Lists can contain lists as
members, so the type of lists is a recursive data type.

Values of the aggregate types, namely sets, strings and lists can be
constructed from existing ones by adding a new member with the
`cons` operator. This is a binary operator for which the first
parameter must be a possible new member and the second parameter must be
an aggregate. For sets the new member is added if it is not already
there, and for strings and lists the new member is added in front. Here
are some examples. The programs on the left evaluate to the literals on
the right.

            5  3 {2 1}  cons  cons  3  swap  cons                {1 2 3 5}
            'E  'C  "AB"  cons  cons  'C  swap  cons               "CECAB"
            5  [6]  [1 2]  cons  cons  'A  swap  cons       ['A 5 [6] 1 2]

As the examples show, the `cons` operator is most useful for adding
elements into an aggregate which is already on the stack below the
aggregate. To add new elements that have just been pushed, the new
elements and the aggregate have to be `swap`ped first before the new
element can be `cons`ed into the aggregate. To facilitate this, Joy has
another operator, `swons`, which first performs a `swap` and then
a `cons`.

Whereas the `cons` and `swons` operators builds up aggregate values, the
two unary operators `first` and `rest` take them apart. Both
are defined only on non-empty aggregate values. For the two ordered
aggregate types, strings and lists, the meaning is obvious: the first
operator returns the first element and the rest operator returns the
string or list without the first element:

            "CECAB"  first                                              'C
            "CECEB"  rest                                           "ECAB"
            ['A 5 [6] 1 2]  first                                       'A
            ['A 5 [6] 1 2]  rest                               [5 [6] 1 2]

But sets are unordered, so it does not make sense to speak of their
first members *as sets*. But since their members are integers, the
ordering on the integers can be used to determine what the first member
is. Analogous considerations apply to the `rest` operator.

            {5 2 3}  first                                                2
            {5 2 3}  rest                                             {3 5}

For all three types of aggregates the members other than the first can
be extracted by repeatedly taking the rest and finally the first of
that. This can be cumbersome for extracting member deep inside. An
alternative is to use the `at` operator to *index* into the
aggregate, by extracting a member **at** a numerically specified
position. For example, the following are two equivalent programs to
extract the fifth member of any aggregate:

            rest  rest  rest  rest  first
            5  at

There is a unary operator which determines the `size` of any
aggregate value. For sets this is the number of members, for strings its
is the length, and for lists it is the length counting only top level
members. The `size` operator yields zero for empty aggregates and a
positive integer for others. There is also a unary `null`
operator, a predicate which yields the truth value `true` for empty
aggregates and `false` for others. Another predicate, the `small`
operator, yields `true` just in case the size is `0` or `1`.

Apart from the operators which only affect the stack, there are two for
explicit input and output. The `get` operator reads an item from
the input file and pushes it onto the stack. The `put` operator
pops an item off the stack and writes it to the screen or whatever the
output file is. The next program reads two pairs of integers and then
compares the sum of the first pair with the sum of the second pair.

            get  get  +  get  get  +  >  put

The two `get` operators attempt to read two items and push them
onto the stack. There they are immediately added, so they have to be
integers. This is repeated for the second pair. At this point the stack
contains the two sums. Then the comparison operator pops the two
integers and replaces them by a truth value, `true` or
`false`, depending on whether the first sum is less than the
second sum. The `put` operator pops that truth value and writes
it. The stack is now as it was before the program was run, only the
input file and the output file are changed.

For another example, the following conducts a silly little dialogue:

            "What is your name?" put "Hello, " get concat put

First the question string is pushed on the stack and then popped to be
written out to the screen. Then the `'"Hello, "'` string is pushed.
Next, the `get` operator reads an item from the keyboard and pushes it
onto the stack. That item has to be another string, because it will be
concatenated with what is below it on the stack. The resultant string is
then written out. So, if in answer to the question a user types
`'"Pat"'`, the program finally writes out `'"Hello, Pat"'`.

In addition to the compound data types set, string and list, John
Cowan\'s extension provides a large number of operators for manipulating
the file system: opening, closing, deleting files, and various
input-output operators. These are outside the scope of this tutorial.

## Quotations and Combinators

Lists are really just a special case of *quoted program*s. Lists only
contain values of the various types, but quoted programs may contain
other elements such as operators and some others that are explained
below. A *quotation* can be treated as passive data structure just like
a list. For example,

            [ +  20  *  10  4  - ]

has size `6`, its second and third elements are `20` and `*`, it can be
reversed or it can be concatenated with other quotations. But passive
quotations can also be made active by *dequotation*.

If the above quotation occurs in a program, then it results in the
quotation being pushed onto the stack - just as a list would be pushed.
There are many other ways in which that quotation could end up on top of
the stack, by being concatenated from its parts, by extraction from a
larger quotation, or by being read from the input. No matter how it got
to be on top of the stack, it can now be treated in two ways: passively
as a data structure, or actively as a program. The square brackets
prevented it from being treated actively. Without them the program would
have been executed: it would expect two integers which it would add,
then multiply the result by 20, and finally push 6, the difference
between 10 and 4.

Joy has certain devices called *combinator*s which cause the execution
of quoted programs that are on top of the stack. This section describes
only a very small proportion of them.

One of the simplest is the `i` combinator. Its effect is to
execute a single program on top of the stack, and nothing else.
Syntactically speaking, its effect is to remove the quoting square
brackets and thus to expose the quoted program for execution.
Consequently the following two programs are equivalent:

            [ +  20  *  10  4  - ]  i
              +  20  *  10  4  -

The `i` combinator is mainly of theoretical significance, but it is used
occasionally. The many other combinators are essential for programming
in Joy.

One of the most well-known combinators is for branching. The
`ifte` combinator expects three quoted programs on the stack, an
if-part, a then-part and an else-part, in that order, with the else-part
on top. The `ifte` combinator removes and saves the three quotations and
then performs the following on the remainder of the stack: It executes
the if-part which should leave a truth value on top of the stack. That
truth value is saved and the stack is restored to what it was before the
execution of the if-part. Then, if the saved truth value was `true`, the
`ifte` combinator executes the then-part, otherwise it executes the
else-part.

In most cases the three parts would have been pushed in that order just
before the `ifte` combinator is executed. But any or all of the three
parts could have been constructed from other quotations.

In the following example the three parts are pushed just before the
`ifte` combinator is executed. The program looks at a number on top of
the stack, and if it is greater than 1000 it will halve it, otherwise it
will triple it.

            [1000 >]  [2 /]  [3 *]  ifte

Some combinators require that the stack contains values of certain
types. Many are analogues of higher order functions familiar from other
programming languages: `map`, `filter` and `fold`.
Others only make sense in Joy. For example, the `step` combinator
can be used to access all elements of an aggregate in sequence. For
strings and lists this means the order of their occurrence, for sets it
means the underlying order. The following will `step` through the
members of the second list and `swons` them into the initially empty
first list. The effect is to reverse the non-empty list, yielding
`[5 6 3 8 2]`.

            []  [2 8 3 6 5]  [swons]  step

The `map` combinator expects an aggregate value on top of the
stack, and it yields another aggregate of the same size. The elements of
the new aggregate are computed by applying the quoted program to each
element of the original aggregate. An example was already given in the
introduction.

Another combinator that expects an aggregate is the `filter`
combinator. The quoted program has to yield a truth value. The result is
a new aggregate of the same type containing those elements of the
original for which the quoted program yields `true`. For example, the
quoted program `['Z >]` will yield truth for characters whose numeric
values is greater than that of `Z`. Hence it can be used to remove upper
case letters and blanks from a string. So the following evaluates to
`"ohnmith"`:

            "John Smith"   ['Z >]   filter

Sometimes it is necessary to add or multiply or otherwise combine all
elements of an aggregate value. The `fold` combinator can do just
that. It requires three parameters: the aggregate to be folded, the
quoted value to be returned when the aggregate is empty, and the quoted
binary operation to be used to combine the elements. In some languages
the combinator is called reduce (because it turns the aggregate into a
single value), or insert (because it looks as though the binary
operation has been inserted between any two members). The following two
programs compute the sum of the members of a list and the sum of the
squares of the members of a list. They evaluate to 10 and 38,
respectively.

            [2 5 3]  0  [+]  fold
            [2 5 3]  0  [dup * +]  fold

To compute the average or arithmetic mean of the members of a set or a
list, we have to divide the sum by the size. (Because of the integer
arithmetic, the division will produce an inaccurate average.) The
aggregate needs to be looked at twice: once for the sum and once for the
size. So one way to compute the average is to duplicate the aggregate
value first with the `dup` operator. Then take the `sum` of the
top version. Then use the `swap` operator to interchange the
position of the sum and the original aggregate, so that the original is
now on top of the stack. Take the size of that. Now the stack contains
the sum and the size, with the size on top. Apply the division operator
to obtain the average value.

            dup  0  [+]  fold  swap  size  /

One nice feature of this little program is that it works equally for set
values as for list values. This is because the constituents `fold` and
`size` work for both types.

But there are two aspects of this program which are unsatisfactory. One
concerns the `dup` and `swap` operators which make the program hard to
read. The other concerns the sequencing of operations: The program
causes the computation of the sum to occur before the computation of the
size. But it does not matter in which order they are computed, in fact
on a machine with several processors the sum and the size could be
computed in parallel. Joy has a combinator which addresses this problem:
there is **one** data parameters, the aggregate, which is to be fed to
**two** functions. From each of the functions a value is to be
constructed, by calling both functions by means of a combinator
**cleave** which produces two values, one for the sum and one for the
size. The program for the average looks like this:

            [0 [+] fold]   [size]   cleave   /

## Definitions

In conventional languages the definition of a function of one or more
arguments has to name these as formal parameters `x`, `y` \... For
example, the squaring function might be defined by some variation of any
of the following:

            square(x)  =  x * x
            (defun (square x)  (* x x))
            square  =  lambda x.x * x

In Joy formal parameters such as `x` above are not required, a
definition of the squaring function is simply

            square   ==   dup  *

This is one of the principal differences between Joy and those languages
that are based on the lambda calculus. The latter include (the purely
functional subsets of) Lisp, Scheme, ML and Haskell. All of these are
based on the application of functions to arguments or actual parameters.

In definitions and abstractions of functions the formal parameters have
to be named - `x`, `y` and so on, or something more informative. This is
different in Joy. It is based on the composition of functions and not on
the application of functions to arguments. In definitions and
abstractions of functions the arguments do not need be named and as
formal parameters indeed cannot be named. One consequence is that there
are no *environment*s of name-value pairs. Instead the work of
environments is done by higher order functions called combinators.

Finally, the concrete syntax of the language is an integral part of the
language and aids in reasoning about Joy programs in the metalanguage.

Suppose it is required to transform a list of numbers into the list of
their cubes. The cube of a single number is of course computed by

            dup  dup  *  *

It would be possible to introduce a definition of the cube function. But
that would introduce another name, `cube`. If the cube function is used
only once for computing the cubes of a list of numbers, then it may not
be desirable to give a definition of it at all. In Joy the list of cubes
is computed by the first line below, but it is also possible to give an
explicit definition as in the second line.

            [dup dup * *]  map
            cubelist   ==   [dup dup * *] map

In a language that is based on the lambda calculus both would need a
lambda abstraction with a variable, say `x`, for the number to be cubed.
And of course the second line would need an additional formal parameter,
say `l`, or a lambda abstraction with a variable `l` for the list to
which the cubelist function is to be applied.

Suppose now that it is required to transform a *list of lists* of
numbers into the *list of lists* of their cubes. One might give the
definition

            cubelistlist   ==   [ [dup dup * *] map ]  map

Of course, if that function is only to be used once, one might not
bother to give a definition at all but use the right hand side directly.
In languages based on abstraction, at least two formal parameters are
needed just for the right hand side, and another for the definition
itself. For example, in Scheme the definition looks like this:

            (define (cubelistlist ll)
                    (map (lambda (l)
                         (map (lambda (n) (* n (* n n)))
                               l ) )
                     ll )

Here the two formal parameters are `n` for the number and `l` for the
list of numbers on the right hand side, and `ll` for the list of lists
of numbers in the definition itself.

As in other languages, definitions can be recursive in Joy. In the first
line below is a recursive definition of the factorial function in one of
many variants of conventional notation. In the second line is a
recursive definition in Joy.

            factorial(x)  =  if x = 0 then 1 else x * factorial(x - 1)
            factorial  ==  [0 =] [pop 1] [dup 1 - factorial *] ifte

Again the Joy version does not use a formal parameter `x`. It works like
this: The definition uses the `ifte` combinator immediately after
the if-part, the then-part and the else-part have been pushed.

The `ifte` combinator then does this: it executes the if-part, in this
case `[0 =]`, which tests whether the (anonymous) integer parameter is
equal to zero. If it is, then the if-part is executed, in this case
`[pop 1]`, which pops the parameter off the stack and replaces it by
one. Otherwise the else-part is executed, in this case
`[dup 1 - factorial *]`. This uses `dup` to make another copy of the
parameter and subtracts one from the copy. Then the `factorial` function
is called recursively on that. Finally the original parameter and the
just computed factorial are multiplied.

The definition could be shortened and made a little more efficient by
using the inbuilt predicate `null` which tests for zero and the
`pred` operator which takes the predecessor of a number. But these
changes are insignificant.

For more complex functions of several arguments it is necessary to be
able to access the arguments anywhere in the definition. Joy avoids
formal parameters altogether, and hence in general arbitrary access has
to be done by mechanisms more sophisticated than `dup`, `swap` and
`pop`.

Here are some more definitions that one might have:

            sum   ==   0  [+]  fold
            product   ==   1  [*]  fold
            average   ==   [sum]  [size]  constr12  /
            concatenation   ==   ""  [concat]  fold

The last definition is for an operator which yields a single string
which is the concatenation of a list of strings.

## Recursive Combinators

If one wanted to compute the list of factorials of a given list, this
could be done by\

            [ factorial ]  map

But this relies on an external definition of factorial. It was necessary
to give that definition explicitly because it is recursive. If one only
wanted to compute factorials of lists of numbers, then it would be a
minor nuisance to be forced to define factorial explicitly just because
the definition is recursive.

A high proportion of recursively defined functions exhibit a very simple
pattern: There is some test, the if-part, which determines whether the
ground case obtains. If it does, then the non-recursive then-part is
executed. Otherwise the recursive else-part has to be executed. In the
else-part there is only *one* recursive call, and there can be something
before the recursive call and something after the recursive call. It
helps to think of the else-part to have two components, the else1-part
before the recursive call, and the else2-part after the recursive call.
This pattern is called *linear recursion*, and it occurs very
frequently.

Joy has a useful device, the `linrec` combinator, which allows
computation of anonymous functions that *might* have been defined
recursively using a linear recursive pattern. Whereas the `ifte`
combinator requires three quoted parameters, the `linrec` combinator
requires four: an if-part, a then-part, an else1-part and an else2-part.
For example, the factorial function could be computed by

            [null]  [succ]  [dup pred]  [*]  linrec

There is no need for a definition, the above program can be used
directly.

Very frequently the if-part of a linear recursion tests for a simple
base condition which depends on the type of the parameter. For numbers
that condition tends to be being zero, for sets, strings and lists that
condition tends to be being empty. The else1-part frequently makes the
parameter smaller in some way. For numbers it decrements them, for sets,
strings and lists it takes the `rest`.

Joy has another useful combinator which has the appropriate if-part and
else1-part built in. This is the `primrec` combinator, which only
has to be supplied with two quotation parameters, the (modified)
then-part and the else2-part of linear recursion. For the factorial
function the two quotation parameters are very simple:

            [1]  [*]  primrec

computes the factorial function. So, if one wanted to compute the list
of factorial of a given list of numbers this can be done by either of
the following:

            [ [null]  [succ]  [dup pred]  [*]  linrec ]   map
            [ [1]  [*]  primrec ]   map

The factorial of a number is the product of successive natural numbers
up to the actual parameter. The following compute instead their sums and
the sum of their squares:

            [0]  [+]  primrec
            [0]  [dup * +]  primrec

Many of the Joy combinators are polymorphic in the sense that they can
be applied to parameters of quite different types. The combinator
`primrec` can be applied not only to numbers but also to lists. For
example, applied to the list `[1 2 3]` the program

            [[]]  [[] cons cons]  primrec

produces the list `[1 [2 [3 []]]]`. Lisp programmers will recognise a
similarity to "dotted pairs". In the following, the first turns a set
of numbers into a list, the second turns a list of numbers into a set:

            [[]]  [cons]  primrec
            [{}]  [cons]  primrec

In fact, the first can also be applied to a list and the second can also
be applied to a set. But in that case they just compute the identity.
They can even be applied to numbers - and then they produce a list or a
set of numbers from the parameter down to 1.

In many recursive definitions there are two recursive calls of the
function being defined. This is the pattern of *binary recursion*, and
it is used in the usual definitions of quicksort and of the Fibonacci
function. Joy has a facility that eliminates the need for a recursive
definition, the `binrec` combinator.

The following will *quicksort* a list whose members can be a mixture of
anything except lists. The program easily fits onto one line, but for
reference it is here written over several numbered lines:

        1           [small]
        2           []
        3           [uncons [>] split]
        4           [[swap] dip cons concat]
        5           binrec

This is how it works: Lines 1..4 each push a quoted program. In line 5
the `binrec` combinator is called, and it will make use of the four
quoted programs and below that the list to be sorted. The four quoted
programs are saved elsewhere, and the `binrec` combinator begins by
executing the program from line 1. This tests whether the list to be
sorted is small, i.e. has at most one member. If indeed it is small,
then it is sorted already.

The `binrec` combinator now executes the program from line 2, which does
nothing and hence leaves the small list as it is. On the other hand, if
the list is not small, then the programs in lines 3 and 4 will be
executed. The program in line 3 removes the first element from the list
and uses it as a pivot to split the rest of the list into two sublists,
by using the comparison function in `[>]` and the `split` combinator.

At this point the `binrec` combinator calls itself recursively on the
two sublists and sorts them both. Finally the program in line 4 combines
the two sorted versions and the original pivot into a single sorted
list. The three items are not quite in the required order, so the
`[swap] dip` part puts the pivot in between the two sorted lists.

Then `cons` puts the pivot in front of the topmost string or list, and
finally `concat` combines everything into one single sorted list. Since
all operations in the program also work on strings, the program itself
can equally well be used to sort a string.

In fact, the program can be used on sets too, but this of course is
pointless. The program is useful, it is part of the Joy system library
under the name of `qsort`.

Many other functions are often defined by recursive definitions that use
binary recursion. In Joy they can all be computed with the `binrec`
combinator without the need for a definition. For example, the following
computes the *Fibonacci* function; it implements the usual inefficient
algorithm:

            [small]  []  [pred dup pred]  [+]  binrec

The system library of course contains the well known efficient
algorithm.

There are only a few second order combinators, ones which require a
first order combinator as parameter. One of the is `treerec` for
recursing through *tree*s. These are either anything but a list, or
lists of trees. For example, in the following `treerec` is given `[map]`
as a parameter, which in turn will be given `[dup *]` as a parameter
when `treerec` encounters a list. The function to be applied to numbers
possibly deeply embedded within lists is the squaring function
`[dup *]`.

Here is an example:

            [ 1 [2 3] [[[4]]] 5 ]  [dup *]  [map]  treerec

produces

            [ 1 [2 9] [[[16]]] 25 ]

All of these combinators can be defined in other functional languages,
but they are less useful there. This is because their parameters have to
be abstractions with variables, and not quotations as in Joy.

## Programming with aggregates

The *aggregate* types of Joy are lists, sets and strings. There are
several unary operators which take an aggregate as parameter and produce
as value a list of subaggregates. One of these is the `powerlist`
operator. For an aggregate of size `N` it produces a list of all the
`2^N` subaggregates.

Here is an example:

            [1 2 3]  powerlist

produces as result

            [ [1 2 3] [1 2] [1 3] [1] [2 3] [2] [3] [] ]

If the ordering does not suit, the result list can always be rearranged,
for example it can be reversed. For another example, one can sort the
list according to size. The `mk_qsort` combinator expects an
aggregate and a quoted operator as parameters and it applies the
operator to each member of the aggregate to use as the basis for sorting
them.

            [1 2 3]  powerlist  [size]  mk_qsort

produces as a result

            [ [] [1] [2] [3] [1 2] [1 3] [2 3] [1 2 3] ]

The powerlist operators can also be applied to a string. The result is a
list of all substrings. In the following the result list is
`filter` to retain only those substrings whose size is greater
than 3. This is achieved by the `filter` combinator which expects
an aggregate and a quoted predicate. The first line is the program, the
second line is the result:

            "abcde"  powerlist  [size 3 >]  filter
            [ "abcde" "abcd" "abce" "abde" "acde" "bcde" ]

The powerlist operators can also be applied to a set. In the program on
the first line below the list of subsets is then filtered to retain only
those of size 3; the result is the list of subsets in the second line:

            {1 2 3 4}  powerlist  [size 3 =]  filter
            [ {1 2 3} {1 2 4} {1 3 4} {2 3 4} ]

Suppose it is required to find the list, in ascending order, of all sums
of any three distinct numbers taken from a given set of numbers. We
already know how to get the list of all three-membered subsets. Each
should be replaced by its sum, and that can be done with the `map`
combinator applied to the whole list. The resulting list of sums then
needs to be sorted. The example in the first line does just that, giving
the result in the second line:

            {1 2 3 4 5}  powerlist  [size 3 =] filter  [sum] map  qsort
            [6 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 12]

In the remainder of this section a small program is to be constructed
which takes one sequence as parameter and returns the list of all
*permutation*s of that sequence. Here is a first draft:

    1         If  S has only zero or one member
    2             then it has only one permutation, so take its unit list
    3             else  take the first and rest of S,
                        recurse to construct the permutations of the rest
    4                   insert the first in all positions in all permutations

The recursion pattern is linear, so we can use the `linrec`
combinator to arrive at this first incomplete program:

    1       [ small ]
    2       [ unitlist ]
    3       [ uncons ]
    4       [ "insert the first in all positions in all permutations" ]
    5       linrec

The anonymous recursion between steps 3 and 4 will have left a list of
permutations of the rest of `S` on top of the stack.

Next, it is necessary to insert the original first of `S` into all
positions into all these resulting permutations. This involves replacing
each single permutation by a list of permuations with the original first
inserted in all places.

This calls for the `map` combinator to apply a *constructed
program* to each permutation. The original first is currently the second
item on the stack. to make it available to the program to be
constructed, it is `swap`ped to the top. The required program consists
of a constant part and a variable part.

The constant part now has to be pushed onto the stack. Then the first is
`cons`ed into the required program. Then `map` will create a list of
list of permutations. But this is a two-level list, and it should be
one-level. So the two level list has to be flattened to a one-level
list.

    4.1             [ swap
    4.2               [ "the constant part of the program" ]
    4.3               cons map
    4.4               "flatten the resulting list of lists of sequences" ]

The constant part of the constructed program has to be written next. The
constructed program will be used to `map` all permutations of the rest,
and in each case it will begin by pushing the original first on top of
the current permutation being mapped. It then has to insert this first
into all positions of the current permutation.

This again calls for a linear recursion with `linrec`. One way to
do this is to give this anonymous recursive function just one parameter,
the current permutation with the original first `swons` in as an initial
element. So the task is now to insert this inital element into all
positions in the remainder which is the current permutation.

    4.2.2.1         If  the current sequence is small
    4.2.2.2             then return just its unit list
    4.2.2.3             else  keep  1. a copy
                                    2. its second and
                                    3. the sequence without its second
                              anonymously recurse on 3.
    4.2.2.4                   construct a program to insert the second
                              use map to do the insertion
                              use cons to add the copy from 1.

So the constant part 4.2 looks like this:

    4.2.1             [ swons
    4.2.2.1             [ small ]
    4.2.2.2             [ unitlist ]
    4.2.2.3             [ dup unswons [uncons] dip swons ]
    4.2.2.4             [ swap [swons] cons map cons ]
    4.2.2.5             linrec ]

The only other part that needs to be written is for flattening. This
should be trivial by now: If the list is small, then take its unit list
else take its first and its rest anonymously recurse on the rest,
concatenate the saved first into the result.

Here is the required program:
\

    4.4             [ null ] [ ] [ uncons ] [ concat]  linrec

The entire program now is the following:
\

    1               [ small ]
    2               [ unitlist ]
    3               [ uncons ]
    4.1             [ swap
    4.2.1             [ swons
    4.2.2.1             [ small ]
    4.2.2.2             [ unitlist ]
    4.2.2.3             [ dup unswons [uncons] dip swons ]
    4.2.2.4             [ swap [swons] cons map cons ]
    4.2.2.5             linrec ]
    4.3               cons map
    4.4               [null] [] [uncons] [concat] linrec ]
    5               linrec.

An essentially identical program is in the Joy library under the name
`permlist`. It is considerably shorter than the one given here
because it uses two subsidiary programs `insertlist` and
`flatten` which are useful elsewhere. The program given above is
an example of a non-trivial program which uses the `linrec`
combinator three times and the `map` combinator twice, with
*constructed program*s as parameters on both occasions.

Of course such a program can be written in lambda calculus languages
such as *Lisp*, *Scheme*, *ML* or *Haskell*, but it would need many
recursive definitions with attendant named formal parameters.
